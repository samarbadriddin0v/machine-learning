<h2>üßê Features</h2>

Here're some of the project's best features:

* <b>Face Mesh</b> is a cutting-edge machine learning model designed for facial landmark detection and tracking. This technology allows for the precise identification and mapping of key points on a person's face such as eyes nose mouth and facial contours. By employing sophisticated neural networks Face Mesh enables applications ranging from facial animation and augmented reality to emotion recognition and biometric authentication. This model's accuracy and real-time capabilities make it invaluable for a variety of interactive experiences and applications in computer vision.
* <b>Hand Pose</b> models are specialized machine learning algorithms developed to accurately recognize and track the intricate movements and configurations of the human hand. These models utilize advanced deep learning techniques to interpret the positions of individual fingers and the overall hand structure in real-time. Applications for Hand Pose models are diverse including virtual reality interactions sign language recognition gesture-based controls and immersive gaming experiences. The ability to precisely capture hand movements enhances user engagement and interaction in a variety of technological domains.
* <b>Pose Detection</b> models focus on identifying and tracking the human body's skeletal structure allowing for the understanding of body postures and movements. These models leverage neural networks to analyze images or video frames and estimate the positions of joints and key body parts. Pose Detection finds applications in sports analytics fitness tracking human-computer interaction and healthcare. By providing a detailed understanding of body movements this technology contributes to the development of immersive experiences gesture-controlled interfaces and applications aimed at improving physical well-being.
* <b>Body Segmentation</b> models are designed to separate and identify the human body from the background in images or videos. These models employ semantic segmentation techniques to precisely outline the contours of a person's body enabling a range of applications. Body Segmentation is crucial for virtual try-on experiences green screen effects in video production and augmented reality applications. By isolating the human form this technology facilitates more realistic and engaging visual experiences offering innovative solutions in fields like fashion entertainment and online communication.
